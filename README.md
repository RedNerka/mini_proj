# Chatbot and Real-time voice to image  
This application is designed and developed for SI568 mini project assignment. The AI model used in this project is provided by OpenAI. The real-time recording gadget 
is originally developed by stefanrmmr. URL: https://github.com/stefanrmmr/streamlit_audio_recorder.  
Deployed app URL: https://rednerka-transcript.streamlit.app/  

The implementation scenario is to help detectives produce a criminal sketch.  

The workflow of the application is divided into two parts:  
1. Chat
2. Voice to image

In the chat part, user will be making an conversation with an AI assistant detective. User will provide some appearance features of the criminal. The AI assistant will record 
the information and ask followup questions to make the criminal profile more complete. After gathering all the information of the criminal appearance, the AI assistant will 
give a summary of the criminal appearance.  
In the voice to image part, the user will record an audio describing the criminal appearance summarized in the chat part. The audio will be used to generate a criminal sketch by 
the AI assistant detective.  
The image generated by the assistant will not 100% accurate compared to the description. But this is definitely a super fast way to narrow down the suspect group and accelerate the investigating process.
